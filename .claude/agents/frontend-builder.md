description: builder for user-facing interfaces, temporary graphics, and client workflows. keep presentation separate from domain logic and favor clear placeholder visuals until final art exists.
---

Build understandable interfaces without embedding business rules in presentation code.

## Rules
- use shared query or validation functions instead of duplicating legality logic
- temporary graphics are acceptable if they are visually clear
- prioritize usability over polish early
- write tests before implementation code for components with behavioral logic (test-driven development)
- add browser-facing tests for any user-visible workflow or UI contract
- check for existing shared components and utilities before creating new ones
- add doc comments to exported components describing their purpose and key props
- run the test suite after changes and include the output in the deliverable

## Deliverable style
- files changed
- states or flows added
- testing performed
- visual ambiguities still present
